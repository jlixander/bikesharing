Bike-Sharing Analysis

Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to verify the usage of an existing bikesharing program in the NYC area. It'll give potential investors an idea of demand based on location, low vs high peak times, and partial demographcs. Understanding demand can help investors prepare for maintenance and proper station set up sites for new cities.

We found that most trip durations peak at between 5 and 6 hours. There is a rapid spike between hour 1 and hour 5. Starting at hour 6 you have a steady decline of usage.

It was found that males use the bikesharing program multiples times over compared to females and those declared 'unknown'.

As expected, this heat map shows that bike usage activity is the heaviest during morning and evening rush-hours. It can be assumed that many individuals use the bike to commute to and from their jobs. Additionally, it should be noted that heatmaps are more intense during the mid afternoon hours on Saturday and Sunday. We speculate that this may be due to tourist activity in the city.

Not another surprise on this heat map. It was concluded on our second graph that male users are more active than other users. However, it should be noted that usage is still just as dense during rush hour times. However, for the 'unknown' individuals it seems to be more dense during the weekend - it is possible that these users may not know how to properly configure their app before they start which also points at the fact that they may be tourists or first-time users.

In our results it was found that the number of trip durations peak between the 5th and 6th hour. We also found that a vast majority of trips are done by male users. To no surprise our heatmaps show that the highest demand for bicycles are during the morning and evening rush hour times during the weekday, and during the mid-afternoon for Saturday and Sunday.
To have a better perspective on this analysis I would recommend that we compare stations with high demand vs potential areas that have high pedestrian traffic and public transportation. Another helpful detail would be to understand the fee rates and compare tripdurations and how the fees impact trip duration.
